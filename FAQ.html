                How do I calculate annual training package cost for my Company?
            </summary>
            <div>
                Training subscription cost is annual based upon total manpower (contracted own employees) working in the company.
                <br>
                <br>
                Suppose company Roll manpower is  50 & Contracted Manpower is 60. Then total Employee count will be 50+60 = 110 no.s. Since 110 >100, Upto 100 manpower cost is not applicable. So, company has to pay amount as defined for upto 200 manpower.
